# UFO Sightings Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to assist with the analysis of UFO sightings by creating a web page which includes a data table that users can filter based on five relevant criteria. This should assist users in narrowing the data they based on their specific needs or interests. 

### The five available criteria are,

- Date of sighting
- City where sighting occurred
- State where sighting occurred
- Country where sighting occurred
- Shape of UFO sighted

## Results
### Finding the table
As users scroll past the page’s banner and main article, they will find the table. The data table will be fully populated with all of the UFO data by default. To the left of the table are five boxes where the user may enter search criteria.

### Filtering the table
Users may enter the criteria by which they wish to filter the table into the boxes. Upon clicking away from the box or pressing the Enter key, the table will be filtered based on the information entered.

Users may filter the table based on any combination of all or some of the five criteria simply by adding information to each of the boxes. When the user clicks away or strikes the Enter key, the table will be filtered based on ALL of the given information.

To delete criteria, the user may clear a box and re-filter the table by clicking away or pressing the Enter key.

Although multiple boxes may be used at once, each box will accept only one field. Attempting to enter more than one field, such as two state abbreviations will return an empty table.

## Summary
This webpage provides users an easy and functional way to filter and view data on UFO sightings.

### Drawback
One drawback of this design is that multiple terms cannot be entered into one field. For example, we may wish to allow users to search for events on multiple dates or within a given range.

### Further Development
This page could be developed further by adding a search field to narrow results on the remaining two fields, “Duration” and “Comments.” Users, for example, may be seeking to study only UFO sightings that lasted for more than 1 minute. 

Another opportunity for development lies in the filter boxes themselves. As the table functions now, users have to know what they’re looking for. If each search box had a drop-down menu that included every city available in the table, they may encounter new and useful information that they did not know they should be looking for. Users will be able to see what cities (or other fields) populate the table without having to look through the entire table.
